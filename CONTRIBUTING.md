# Contribution after cloning

When contributing to this project, there are a few guidelines to keep in mind; readability, coherence and maintainability and passing status checks. 

Each part that you contribute with should be clear and self explanatory meaning that your code for example should be easy to read and commented very well. 
Unless your account is added as a collaborator to this repository, you are going to have to fork it, create a new branch and  and start developing and pushing code to that branch with brief and understandable commit messages.

When you are done, you will create a pull request from your new branch to the base branch in the original repository. Your pull request has to include a pull request comment explaining what changes you made and why.
